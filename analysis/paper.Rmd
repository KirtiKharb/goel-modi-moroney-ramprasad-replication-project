## Introduction

Lately, there has been a lot of effort and research on identifying content that is abusive or offensive on online and social media. Twitter recently published a relatively large and reliable dataset on ‘Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter’. As Data Scientists, we fully understand the need to find the best methods and data for identifying such content and flagging it as inappropriate.
 
In this project, our aim is to replicate some of the findings in a research paper titled '[Comparative Studies of Detecting Abusive Language on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10245)' [see @originalarticle] that performs a comparative study and provides suggestions for using additional features and data for improving such classification of hate and abusive speech using Twitter data. 

Using the data and code provided by the authors, we aim to replicate the efficacy and accuracy for Logistic Regression model. Our ultimate goal is to understand this model classifies different types of tweets and generate similar results for precision, recall and F1 score as reported by the authors. The choice of model to reproduce is based on the observation that the top precision has been generated by Logistic Regression as well as our experimental constraints for executing the code.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

The original data file had 30 attributes. The following were 3 attributes are relevant to our analysis.

1. tweet_id - unique identifier for each tweet 
2. tweet_text - raw tweet (uncleaned)
3. does_this_tweet_contain_hate_speech - classification of tweets with 3 different classes

Below is a snapshot of original data. 

```{r raw-data-analysis, echo = FALSE}
#Keeping only the necessary columns
library(here)
library(knitr)
raw_data <- read.csv(here("Data","twitter-hate-speech-classifier-data.csv"))
raw_data = raw_data[c("tweet_id", "tweet_text", "does_this_tweet_contain_hate_speech")]
kable(head(raw_data,7),caption = "Raw data")
```


### Tweet classification

In this dataset, the tweets are classfied in the following three classes:

1. The tweet contains hate speech 
2. The tweet is not offensive
3. The tweet uses offensive language but not hate speech	

Below is a visual representation of the distribution of tweets by classes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
d <- data.frame(summary(raw_data$does_this_tweet_contain_hate_speech))
names(d) <- c('Number of Tweets')
print(d)
raw_data$class <- as.numeric(raw_data$does_this_tweet_contain_hate_speech)
source(here("analysis","004-display-bargraph.R"))
plotBarGraph(raw_data)
```

To get a better idea of the sentiments behind tweets, we used the R package 'WordCloud', which generates a word cloud of the most frequent words in the given tweets.

```{r word-cloud-using-function-call}
include_graphics(here("analysis","WordCloud.png"))
```


### Data pre-processing

The original dataset contained 14,509 tweets. When we tried to run our processing scripts over this data, we ended up generating huge intermediate modeling datasets which could not be processed on our local machines. Therefore for our replication study, we have taken a random sample of 3000 tweets from the original dataset 'twitter-hate-speech-classifier-data.csv', which approximately represents the original distribution of classes.

Below is a visual representation of the distribution of tweets by classes for the sampled dataset.

```{r}

sampled_data <- read.csv(here("Data","sampled_tweet_dataset.csv"))
d <- data.frame(summary(sampled_data$does_this_tweet_contain_hate_speech))
names(d) <- c('Number of Tweets')
print(d)
sampled_data$class <- as.numeric(sampled_data$does_this_tweet_contain_hate_speech)
source(here("analysis","004-display-bargraph.R"))
plotBarGraph(sampled_data)

```


As part of pre-processing, following steps were taken to clean the 'tweet_text' column.

1. Converted all strings to lower case - Used base R (tolower function)
2. Removed everything that is not a numner or alphabet - using stringr package 
3. Removed punctuations, special characters, twitter handles, emojis  - using stringr package 
4. Removed most frequent 200 stopgap words - using tm package

Here is the quick comparison between raw and cleaned tweets after pre-processing steps.

```{r Loading-Libraries, echo=FALSE}

```


```{r Data-Preparation, echo=FALSE}
#data.frame(refined_data$tweet_text, refined_data$tweet_clean1)
```

## Tokenization and one-hot encoding

The next step in reproducing is to create features for the model by tokeninzing the tweets. In original python code, the authors have used nltk library. We tried various packages in R which provide tokenization functions. Ultimately, we found that 'quanteda' package in R was most suitable to generate similar tokens as original code. 

The following code chunk provides a glimpse of a tweet before and after tokenization.

```{r tokenization}

#To be fixed Tokenization
#data.frame(refined_data$tweet_text, refined_data$tweet_clean1)

```

After tokenization, the next step is to encode the tokens using one-hot encoding to generate features. After one-hot encoding the output csv file was stored in the data folder as **'prepared_tweet_dataset.csv'**. This contains the one-hot encoded data for the selected 3000 tweets which is an input to run the machine learning models.

This dataset can be used to bypass the resource intensive pre-processing steps. It can be used to directly train the model and reproduce the figures that we have claimed to replicate using this project.


## Reproducibility

### Software
The original code for the ‘Comparative Studies of Detecting Abusive Language on Twitter’ was written in language Python and also used TensorFlow. For our replication project, we have attempted to replicate the machine learning model for Logistic Regression in the R language. This involved using different packages and functions in R to process the data as well as build the model and obtain the results.

### Dataset
Additionally, due to limited computational capacity, we randomly selected 3000 tweets from a dataset of 14,509 tweets from the ‘[Hate Speech Dataset] (https://github.com/ENCASEH2020/hatespeech-twitter)’ provided by ENCASE. In the original research paper, the authors were able to execute the models with a dataset containing 100k tweets approximately. This was not necessary for us as we were not building the complex neural network models which require large amounts of data.

### Model
The original paper had a compariative study of 5 different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. However, for our replication purpose we have chosen ‘Logistic Regression’ model using word-level features. This choice was made as the author stated that this model outperformed all the machine learning techniques and had an F1-score which was equivalent to the best CNN model. For our project, we also had limited computational resources due to which execution of other machine learning and deep learning models was out of scope. 

Further, the original paper modeled all algorithms at word and character level separately. But, they stated that character levels models reduced the accuracy for hate and abusive speech data. Therefore, we have chosen only the word-level representation for our replication study. 
 

## Results

Here is a snapshot of the original figures claimed by the authors.

## Conclusion

We are however observing lower precision and recall values than the claimed values. There could be a number of different factors causing this mismatch in the figures. Some of them are the following:

1. We are using considerablly smaller dataset compared to the authors. This was done due to limited processing power.
2. While converting the code repository from Python to R, some of the library functions used in R were not exactly the same as those in Python. These small differences in intermediate stages could have inflated the final diference in figures.
3. Perhaps, the original code itself is not very reproducible and has tendency to generate different results with slight changes.
