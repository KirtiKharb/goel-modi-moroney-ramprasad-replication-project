## ANALYSIS DETAILS

This directory contains the R scripts used in the project as well as the intermediate files that these scripts generate. Please find below details about each file in this directory.

### paper.Rmd

This is the main R markdown file which encapsulates our entire replication analysis. This markdown file executes the R scripts within the analysis directory to generate the results. It uses bibliography.bib to cite the references.

### 001-tweet-cleaning.R

This is the first step in the process of detecting abusive language in tweets. This R script reads the original dataset (twitter-hate-speech-classifier-data.csv), cleans it, and transforms the data to generate the data file "prepared_tweet_dataset.csv", which is used as the input by "002-modeling.R" script to generate the results.

### 002-modeling.R

This R script reads "prepared_tweet_dataset.csv" data file as input, which was generated by the first script, and performs classification of the tweets using Logistic regression. The outputs from this script are saved back in the analysis directory and referenced in the paper.Rmd markdown file at different stages.

### 003-display-bargraph.R

This R script is used to generate a bar graph showing the distribution of the tweets in the three hateful categories.

### Other files

All the other files in this directory are intermediate files which are generated and/or used to replicate the results.
