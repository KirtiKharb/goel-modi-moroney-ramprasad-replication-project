## ANALYSIS DETAILS

This directory contains the R scripts used in the project as well as the intermediate files that these scripts generate. Please find below details about each file in this directory.

### paper.Rmd

This is the main R markdown file, which encapsulates our whole reproduced analysis. This markdown file executes the R scripts within itself to reproduce the results. It uses bibliography.bib to cite the references.

### 001-tweet-cleaning.R

This is the first step in the process of detecting abusive language in tweets. This R script reads the original dataset (twitter-hate-speech-classifier-data.csv), cleans it, and transforms the data to generate the data file "prepared_tweet_dataset.csv", which is used as the input by "002-modeling.R" script to generate the results.

### 002-modeling.R

This R script reads "prepared_tweet_dataset.csv" data file as input, which was generated by the first script, and performs classification of the tweets using Logistic regression.

### 003-display-bargraph.R

This R script is used to generate a bar graph showing the distribution of the tweets in the three hateful categories.

All the other files in this directory are intermediate files which are generated and/or used to reproduce the results.
